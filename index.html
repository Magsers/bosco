              Bosco is a feature-based, serverless test runner that identifies whether the components of a chatbot are
              functional or not, and reports errors if so.
              It was built using Puppeteer, an automation tool, and Mocha, a testing framework. It is designed using an
              AWS Step Function state machine, which runs a Lambda function for each test, or if required, an array of
              tests. </p>
            <p>The application is deployed in a Docker container using a Docker image, and the infrastructure is managed
              and provisioned using AWS CloudFormation.
              The latest results are stored in DynamoDB, with CloudWatch logs also being monitored. Screenshots of
              failed tests are stored in S3, and alerts are sent to Slack to notify developers of any failed tests.

                Bosco was built using Puppeteer, an automation tool that is used for web scraping. It replaced Testcafe,
                which was resource-heavy and slow.

                Bosco will replace Frankenstein, the current test runner, which is run on two EC2 instances. The main
                issue with Frankenstein was it does not scale and more tests cannot be added to it . Bosco is run via a
                Step Function state machine. Theoretically, it is infinitely scalable. It is also billed per execution
                as opposed to Frankenstein, which ran every 20 minutes and was costly.

                Mocha was the chosen test framework for Bosco. It gathers all the tests in an array, runs the tests, and
                reports the results to Cloudwatch. The latest results are stored in DynamoDB. Screenshots are taken of
                failed tests and stored in S3.
