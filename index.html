              Bosco was built for ServisBOT, an artificial intelligence chatbot technology company based in Waterford. 
              It is a feature-based, serverless test runner that runs end to end tests and identifies whether the components of a chatbot are
              functional or not. It was built using Puppeteer, an automation tool and Mocha, a testing framework. It is designed using an
              AWS Step Function, state machine, which runs a Lambda function for each test, or if required, an array of
              tests. </p>
            <p>The application is deployed in a Docker container with the infrastructure being managed
              and provisioned using AWS CloudFormation.
              The latest results are stored in DynamoDB and reported to CloudWatch. Screenshots of
              failed tests are stored in an S3 bucket with alerts sent to a Slack channel to notify the team of any failed tests.

                Bosco was built using Puppeteer, an automation tool that is used for web scraping. It replaced Testcafe,
                which was proven to be resource-heavy and slow.

                Bosco will replace Frankenstein, the current test runner, which is run on EC2 instances. The main
                issue with Frankenstein is it does not scale and more tests cannot be added to it . Bosco is run via a
                lambda step function state machine. Theoretically, it is infinitely scalable. The tests will run in parallel on individual lambda functions as 
                opposed to Frankenstein where all the tests are run in one instance and are competing for memory.

                Mocha was the chosen test framework for Bosco. It gathers all the tests in an array, runs the tests, and
                reports the results to Cloudwatch. The latest results are stored in DynamoDB. Screenshots are taken of
                failed tests and stored in S3.
