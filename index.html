          <p class="intro">
            Bosco is a feature based test runner that is intended to identify whether the components of a
            system are
            disfunctional or not and to report errors if so. It was built using Puppeteer, an automation tool
            and Mocha, a testing framework. It is designed using an AWS state machine, using a step function which runs
            a
            Lambda function for each test or if required, an array of tests. It was deployed using a Docker image and
            Cloud Formation. Screenshots of failed tests are stored in an S3 bucket and alerts are sent to a Slack
            channel
            to notify developers of any failed tests.</p><br>

              replaced Testcafe which
              was resource heavy and slow. </p>

            <p class="card-text">Bosco replaced Frankenstein which was run on two EC2 instances. The main issue with
              Frankenstein was it did not scale, the company
              did not have the ability to add more tests. Bosco is run via a step function state machine. Theoretically
              it
              is infinitely scalable. It is also billed per execution as opposed
              to Frankenstein which ran every 20 minutes and was costly. </p>

            <p class="card-text">Mocha was the chosen test framework for Bosco. It gathers all the tests in an array,
              runs
              the tests and reports the results. These results were accessible in
              Dynamo DB and Cloudwatch. Screenshots are taken of failed tests and stored in S3. </p>
